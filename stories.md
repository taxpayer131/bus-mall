Marketing team
Show three BusMall products at once, in a row, from left to right.
We want an individual to click on the BusMall products they would most likely purchase.
We want the chosen products calculated and stored with the resulting data displayed in an easy-to-read format.
We want the site to stop tracking as soon as a 25th item is selected.

Developer
The app should display 3 random  product images and display the images to the side as they are selected.
As a developer, I do not want the same image to appear more than once in any random selection of three products.
I want to build a button that appears after the focus-group member makes 25 clicks that gives the individual the option to view the market analysis results.

Focus group individual
I want clear instructions on what I am supposed to do.
I want a pleasant, user-friendly interface.
The application needs to be accessible and functional on my mobile device.
